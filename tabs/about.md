I am a PhD Student at the University of Waterloo working with
Professor [Arie Gurfinkel](https://arieg.bitbucket.io/). My research
interests are in formal methods, fully automatic program verification,
and theorem proving.  I am working on solvers for Constrained Horn
Clauses, a fragment of First Order Logic. You can find more about my
work in my [resume]({%link /assets/resume.pdf%})
