I am honoured to be awarded the [Microsoft Research PhD
Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/past-fellows/). 

I hope to use this funding to develop a new core for the Spacer CHC
engine. I have been improving Spacer on several different domains:
integers, bit-vectors, arrays, and ADTs and RFs. I want to make it
easy for Spacer to reason in new domains as well e.g. non-linear
arithmetic. To make this happen, I am looking to give Spacer the
ability to reason about an abstraction of a theory.
