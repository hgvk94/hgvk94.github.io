# Artifact for *Solving Constrained Horn Clauses modulo Algebraic Data Types and Recursive Functions*
This page describes steps to reproduce empirical results from the paper titled "Solving Constrained Horn Clauses modulo Algebraic Data Types and Recursive Functions". The empirical results are presented as Table 1 and Table 2 in section 8 (page 23) of the paper.

Our algorithm is called `Racer`. In our paper submissions, we called it `ALG` to respect the double blind review process. Another discrepancy between the paper and the artifact is that the tool `VeriMAP` is called `adtrem`.

Table 1 compares Racer with 3 other solvers (Spacer, Hoice, and Eldarica) on the `rust-horn` benchmark suite. Table 2 compares Racer with 4 other solvers (Spacer, Eldarica, CVC4 and VeriMAP) on the `leon` benchmark suite.

## Steps to replicate experiment results:
1. Install *docker*

   If you don't already have docker, you will have to setup docker repository and install docker. The instructions can be found at the [docker install page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). For your convenience, we have copy pasted all the required commands for Ubuntu here:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install \
   apt-transport-https \
     ca-certificates \
     curl \
     gnupg \
     lsb-release
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
   echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
 ```
   
   If you are on windows or mac, please follow the instruction from the [docker
   install page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
   
2. Pull image from docker cloud
    Run `docker pull chcmodadtrdf:latest` to pull the artifact image

3. Run short version of experiment to make sure that everything is working. Use the command `docker run --rm -ti chcmodadtrdf:latest ./popl22-ae/test.sh`. This script will run all solvers on all benchmarks for 1 second each. This experiment will take ~30mins and print two tables on the command line.

4. Run full experiment
    * `docker run --rm -ti chcmodadtrdf:latest /bin/sh` to start the docker container
    * `cd /popl22-ae/scripts && ./table1.sh` and `cd /popl22-ae/scripts && ./table2.sh` to replicate the results. The first script should take around 6 hours and the second should take around 8 hours to finish. Both scripts will save the output files in `/popl22-ae/rust-horn-experiment/table1.txt` and `/popl22-ae/leon-experiment/table2.txt` directories and also summarize the results in the shell.
    
## Contents of AE:
- A docker file containing everything required to replicate experiment results: 
  * Executables
  * Source code for Racer and Spacer
  * Benchmarks
  * The following scripts are in the `/popl22-ae/scripts` directory inside the container 
      * table1.sh
      * table2.sh
      * run-racer.sh
      * run-spacer.sh
      * run-eldarica.sh
      * run-cvc4.sh
      * run-adtrem.sh

## Running pre-processing on benchmarks
      The command `/popl22-ae/scripts/run-preprocessing.sh dir` will run our preprocessing steps on all `.smt2` files in the directory `dir` and produce files with `termabs-w-rf` prefix in the same location. This script first identifies horn clauses that encode RDFs and creates RDFs for each such horn clauses. Then, it does term abstraction: for each argument of an uninterpreted predicate to which an RDF can be applied, add an additional argument to the uninterpreted predicate to store the result of applying the RDF on the argument. Modify all horn clauses as necessary to keep track of the new arguments. 
  
## Running Racer
   The command `/popl22-ae/scripts/run-racer.sh /absolute/path/to/bench.smt2
   100` will run our tool `Racer` on the benchmark `bench.smt2` with a timeout
   of `100` seconds. The source code is available on
   [github](https://github.com/hgvk94/z3/tree/racer).
   
   Scripts to run other tools are also available in `/popl22-ae/scripts`. 
   
## Running Racer on your own benchmarks
- Map benchmark directory to a directory inside the docker container
   Run docker with the option `-v /path/to/bench/:/hostBench/` to map the directory `/path/to/bench` in the host machine to `/hostBench` in the docker container. The full command is 
   ```
   docker run -rm -ti -v /path/to/bench/:/hostBench/ chcmodadtrdf:latest /bin/sh
   ```
- Optionally, run preprocessing from inside docker using the command `/popl22-ae/scripts/run-preprocessing.sh /hostBench`. This will create a new benchmark in the same directory
- Run Racer using the command `/popl22-ae/scripts/run-racer.sh /hostBench/termabs-w-rf-bench.smt2`

## Looking at our results
  All our results are stored in `/popl22-ae/paper-results`. For each experiment, we have results for 2 different timeouts: 100s and 1800s
