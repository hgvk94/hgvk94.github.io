We won [CHC Comp again](https://chc-comp.github.io/presentation.pdf) !!! This time we won ALL tracks including LRA. Sadly, we did not improve much on LRA. This is still a big TODO. 

An interesting addition to this year's CHC Comp was the ADT track. We were semi-prepared as we have been working on ways to extend Spacer to CHCs with ADTs and RDFs for the past 8 months. Our work is applicable to CHCs over ADTs **in addition to** other theories like integer arithmetic. However, the benchmarks in the competition were purely over ADTs. They defined sorts like `int`, `nat` using ADTs and functions like `+`, `*` using RDFs. Spacer did not do too badly even in this scenario, even though it was not designed for this situation.

We submitted a [portfolio solver](https://github.com/hgvk94/z3/tree/chccomp21) for this years competition. It runs global guidance on one thread and quic3 on another.
