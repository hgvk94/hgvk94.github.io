We have been working on using equalities and uninterpreted functions
as an abstract layer inside Spacer. A bi-product of this research was
a version of model based projection centered around the theory of EUF
that layers the different theory reasoning on top of an an e-graph. We
wrote a paper solely on quantifier elimination and model based
projection using e-graphs. It received a distinguished paper award at
CAV 2023. You can read the full paper
[here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-37703-7_4). The
code has been merged with
[Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/pull/6820).
